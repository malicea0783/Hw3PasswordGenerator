# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Acceptance Criteria

 Created a random password generator so that when a new, secure password is needed a button is clicked to generate it.

 Generator presents a series of prompts for password criteria including password length (between 8 - 128 characters), 
whether to choose all uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters or any combination of uppercase
letters, lowercase letters, numbers or special characers.

 Input is validated when at least one character type is selected and a password is generated and displayed that is matching 
the input criteria.
